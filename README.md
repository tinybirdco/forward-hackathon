# Tinybird Forward Â» Hackathon
You have 24 hours to build something incredible.

## How to play
Tinybird just launched Forward, a reimagined developer experience that changes the way you work with data. Build something (anything) and deploy it to Tinybird before March 15th, 2025 at 12 PM EDT to win a...

## How to submit
To submit, create a Pull Request to this repository with your project code.

Submissions must include the following:
- All code for your Tinybird data project and accompanying application, if applicable.
- At least one (1) Tinybird data source and one (1) Tinybird API endpoint.
- A simple but coherent README describing what you created and why you think it's worthy.
- A link to a live, deployed demo (or clear instructions on how to deploy the application code).

## How entries will be judged
A panel of five (5) Tinybird employees will rate each submission on the following:
- **Speed**: The earlier you submit, the higher you score.
- **Creativity**: How novel is your submission?
- **Usefulness**: How badly do we want to fork it and use it ourselves?
- **Scale & Performance**: How does the app or service perform under load (data volume + query concurrency)?

## Winners
Each judge will rate each submission on a scale of 0 - 10 for the criteria above. The submission with the highest aggregate score from all judges will win the Grand Prize. The submissions with the 2nd- and 3rd-highest aggregate scores will win Runner Up Prizes. In the event of a tie, the panel of judges will vote to select the winner(s).

## Prizes
